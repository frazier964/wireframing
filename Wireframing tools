There are several popular tools used for creating wireframes, each with its own strengths and features. Some common examples include:

* *Balsamiq:* A low-fidelity wireframing tool known for its sketch-like interface, which helps keep the focus on structure rather than visual design.
* *Sketch:* A vector graphics editor that is also widely used for UI design and prototyping, including creating detailed wireframes. (Note: While powerful, it's primarily for macOS.)
* *Adobe XD:* A comprehensive UI/UX design tool that allows for wireframing, prototyping, and collaboration.
* *Figma:* A web-based design tool that has gained significant popularity for its collaboration features, versatility, and robust free plan.
* *Miro (formerly RealtimeBoard):* A collaborative online whiteboard platform that can be used for various activities, including creating basic wireframes and user flows.

### Figma

Figma is a highly recommended wireframing tool due to its collaborative, web-based nature and powerful feature set. Key features that make it useful for wireframing include:

* *Real-time Collaboration:* Multiple team members can work on the same wireframe simultaneously, making it excellent for team projects and feedback.
* *Versatile Design Capabilities:* Figma allows you to create both low-fidelity and high-fidelity wireframes with its flexible design tools and component library.
* *Prototyping Features:* You can easily turn your wireframes into interactive prototypes to test user flows and interactions.
* *Component Library and Styles:* Figma enables you to create reusable components and define styles, ensuring consistency across your wireframes.
* *Web-Based Accessibility:* Being a web application, Figma can be accessed from any operating system with an internet connection.
* *Free Plan Availability:* Figma offers a generous free plan that is often sufficient for individual users and small teams.

Because of these features, Figma streamlines the wireframing process, facilitates collaboration, and allows for a smooth transition from wireframes to higher-fidelity designs and prototypes.
