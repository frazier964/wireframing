There are several popular tools used for creating wireframes, each with its own strengths and features. Some common examples include:

* *Balsamiq:* A low-fidelity wireframing tool known for its sketch-like interface, which helps keep the focus on structure rather than visual design.
* *Sketch:* A vector graphics editor that is also widely used for UI design and prototyping, including creating detailed wireframes. (Note: While powerful, it's primarily for macOS.)
* *Adobe XD:* A comprehensive UI/UX design tool that allows for wireframing, prototyping, and collaboration.
* *Figma:* A web-based design tool that has gained significant popularity for its collaboration features, versatility, and robust free plan.
* *Miro (formerly RealtimeBoard):* A collaborative online whiteboard platform that can be used for various activities, including creating basic wireframes and user flows.
