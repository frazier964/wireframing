# wireframing
Wireframing is the process of creating a simple, visual blueprint of a website or application's layout. It focuses on the structure, content placement, and user interface (UI) elements without getting into colors, fonts, or detailed graphics. Think of it as the architectural sketch before building a house.
## Key Elements of Wireframing

### Layout/Structure
This refers to the basic arrangement of elements on the screen. It defines the visual hierarchy and how different parts of the interface are organized in relation to each other.

*Example:* A common layout for a blog post might include a header at the top, the main content area in the center, and a sidebar on the right for related links.

### Navigation
Navigation elements allow users to move through the application or website. This includes menus, buttons, links, and search bars.

*Example:* A top navigation menu might contain links to different sections like "Home," "About," "Products," and "Contact."

### Content Placement
This involves deciding where specific types of content (text, images, videos, etc.) will be located within the wireframe. It considers factors like importance, user flow, and visual balance.

*Example:* Placing a prominent call-to-action button below a product description encourages users to take the next step.

### Functionality
While wireframes are primarily visual, they also indicate the basic functions of different elements. This might include interactive elements like buttons that trigger actions or forms for user input.

*Example:* A button labeled "Submit" indicates that clicking it will send the data entered in a form.
