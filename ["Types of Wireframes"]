## Types of Wireframes

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes
Low-fidelity (lo-fi) wireframes are basic, often hand-drawn or digitally sketched, representations of the interface. They focus on the layout, content prioritization, and basic functionality without much detail on visual design.

*Typical Use:* Lo-fi wireframes are usually created in the early stages of the design process to quickly explore different ideas, gather initial feedback, and establish the basic structure of the interface. They are useful for brainstorming and iterating rapidly.

### High-Fidelity Wireframes
High-fidelity (hi-fi) wireframes are more detailed and closer to the final user interface design. They include more specific UI elements, typography, and sometimes even basic styling and interactions.

*Typical Use:* Hi-fi wireframes are typically used later in the design process, often after the basic structure has been established with lo-fi wireframes. They help to visualize the user flow more accurately, refine the design details, and can be used for user testing and stakeholder presentations.
